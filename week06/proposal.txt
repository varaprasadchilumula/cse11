CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

1. What is the title of your program?
   To Do List

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?
   I always have problems to easily organize my tasks, sometimes I have to share these tasks with others, as for work or sometimes with my family, all the apps. I have tried haven't helped me so much to solve this problem.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
   I will learn how to use MySQL with Python, I don't know SQL language so I will have a lot to learn.

4. What Python modules will your program use?
   I'm not sure if the MySQL Python connector is a module, but I will be using it.


5. List the names of functions you will need?
    Functions I can think about at this point:
    - Add task
    - Edit task 
    - Delete task
    - Completed task

6. List the names of the test functions you will write.
   I'm not sure how I will do it, because I don't if using MySQL will make a difference when testing it, but I will do it.

2. For this week I was working in understanding how SQL, MySQL work and how MySQL can be used with Python, I was able to:
    - Create the database
    - Create tables
    - Add new tasks to the database
